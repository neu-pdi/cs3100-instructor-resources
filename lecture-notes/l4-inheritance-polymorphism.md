title: Inheritance and Polymorphism
---

Overview:


## Understand why inheritance is a core concept of object-oriented programming (15 minutes)
- A core principle of program design is: make your data mean something.
- We write software that manipulates data in some way, and oftentimes this data is related to some real-world concept.
- When it comes to designign our program, we can leverage our domain knowledge of that real world concept to design a program that is both easy to understand and easy to maintain.
- Inheritance is a core concept of object-oriented programming that allows us to model real-world "is-a" relationships between types.

## Define a class hierarchy and understand the relationship between superclasses and subclasses (10 minutes)
Background material:
- [Liskov & Gutag Ch 7](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/program-development-in/9780768685299/ch7.html)

(Example of a real-world "is-a" hierarchy, uses UML and also some source code with javadoc)


- Types can share common properties and behavior, but also provide their own methods, and also specialized implementations for certain methods.

## Explain the role of abstract classes and interfaces in a Java class hierarchy (15 minutes)

## Understand the JVM's implementation of dynamic dispatch (10 minutes)

## Identify type errors that can be caught at compile time, and those that can only be caught at runtime (10 minutes)
