## Describe the role of method specifications in achieving program modularity and improving readability (15 minutes)
[Liskov & Gutag Ch 9.3](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/program-development-in/9780768685299/ch9.html)

## Identify errors in type hierarchies and specifications that violate the Liskov Substitution Principle (10 minutes)

## Define the role of methods common to all Objects in Java (20 minutes)

- [Obey the general contract when overriding `equals`](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/effective-java-3rd/9780134686097/ch3.xhtml#lev10)
- [Always override `hashCode` when you override `equals`](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/effective-java-3rd/9780134686097/ch3.xhtml#lev11)
- [Always override `toString`](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/effective-java-3rd/9780134686097/ch3.xhtml#lev12)
- [Consider implementing `Comparable`](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/effective-java-3rd/9780134686097/ch3.xhtml#lev14)

- (Why do we skip Block #13 "Override clone judiciously"? Because we don't think we should even talk about `clone`, other than that it is an artifact of a bad design choice that we are stuck with so should ignore)

## Evaluate the efficacy of a given specification using the terminology of restrictiveness, generality, and clarity (15 minutes)

- [Design method signatures carefully](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/effective-java-3rd/9780134686097/ch8.xhtml#lev51)
