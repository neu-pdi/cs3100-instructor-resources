---

## Analyze the changeability of a software module for some hypothetical change using the language of coupling and cohesion 

### Define and recognize cases of data coupling, stamp coupling, control coupling, common coupling and content coupling (10 minutes)

### Define and recognize cases of functional, sequential, communication, procedural, temporal, logical and coincidental coupling (10 minutes)

### Form qualitative assessments of a design based on specific coupling and cohesion ocurrences (10 minutes)

## Use the vocabulary of coupling and cohesion to review the Strategy and Command patterns (10 minutes)
