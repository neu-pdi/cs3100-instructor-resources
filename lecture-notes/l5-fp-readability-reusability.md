title: Functional Programming, Readability, and Reusability
---

## Understand the historical context of functional programming in the JVM (10 minutes)
- Pre-java 8: Anonymous inner class hell
- Java 8: Lambda expressions and method references
- Other languages: Scala, Kotlin, Clojure, etc.: core motivation and design choices

## Compare the readability of Java code that uses functional vs OO styles (15 minutes)

### [Prefer lambdas to anonymous classes](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/effective-java-3rd/9780134686097/ch7.xhtml#lev42)

### [Prefer method references to lambdas](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/effective-java-3rd/9780134686097/ch7.xhtml#lev43)

### [Favor the use of standard functional interfaces](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/effective-java-3rd/9780134686097/ch7.xhtml#lev44)

## Compare the strategy pattern to higher-order functions (10 minutes)

## Utilize type annotations to express invariants such as non-nullness (15 minutes)
(With a sidebar on JSR-308, nullaway)


## Understand common misconceptions about what makes code "readable" and draw on evidence-based research to evaluate the readability of code (10 minutes)
