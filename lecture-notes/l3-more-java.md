## Recognize and apply Java's core data structures (20 minutes)
We briefly introduced arrays in the previous lecture. As a reminder, here are the properties of arrays in Java:
- Arrays are a fixed size
- Arrays are zero-indexed (first element is at index 0)
- Arrays are stored contiguously in memory, enabling efficient bulk operations (e.g. copy the entire array in constant time)

The Java API also provides a number of core data structures that are useful for programming. Collectively, these are called the *Collections API*. They are implemented as classes in the `java.util` package.

### Lists

### Maps

### Sets


## Explain the role of abstract classes and interfaces in a Java class hierarchy (15 minutes)

## Understand the JVM's implementation of dynamic dispatch (10 minutes)

## Identify type errors that can be caught at compile time, and those that can only be caught at runtime (10 minutes)
