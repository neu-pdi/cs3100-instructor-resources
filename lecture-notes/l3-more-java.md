## Utilize Java methods for reading input and writing output to streams (10 minutes)
In order to do anything useful, we probably need to be able to read input from the outside world (user, file, etc.) and write output to the outside world (user, file, etc.).

We saw how to write output to the console using `System.out.println`.

(Explain what a stream is, how stdin/out/err are special streams, and how to use a `Scanner` to read input from the console.)



## Recognize and apply Java's core data structures (20 minutes)
We briefly introduced arrays in the previous lecture. As a reminder, here are the properties of arrays in Java:
- Arrays are a fixed size
- Arrays are zero-indexed (first element is at index 0)
- Arrays are stored contiguously in memory, enabling efficient bulk operations (e.g. copy the entire array in constant time)

The Java API also provides a number of core data structures that are useful for programming. Collectively, these are called the *Collections API*. They are implemented as classes in the `java.util` package.

### Lists

### Maps

### Sets



## Identify type errors that can be caught at compile time, and those that can only be caught at runtime (10 minutes)
